**************
 INTRODUCTION
**************
Welcome to the UniCC LALR(1) Parser Generator!

UniCC, standing as an acronym for Universal Compiler-Compiler, is a powerful
LALR(1) Parser Generator and Development System for computer professionals.
Its design-goal is to serve as an all-round design and build tool for any
parsing-related issue, including production-quality compiler construction and
the implementation of domains specific languages.

UniCC unions an integrated generator for lexical analyzers and a powerful
LALR(1) parser generator into one software solution.
The programming interface is a rich, extendable and innovative EBNF-based
grammar definition language, which gives any compiler-developer's task much
more comfort and simplicity in implementing parsers than ever before. It comes
with useful features for both grammar prototyping and design, parser
optimization, semantic augmentation and parser programming. Lexical symbols can
be directly defined within productions, right-hand side items can be referenced
by meaningful names within semantic actions, instead of only their offsets.
Features like virtual- and embedded-productions finally help to rapidly build-up
iterative and optional grammatical structures.

Standard features like automatic conflict resolution, terminal and production
precedence association, state compression as well as parser trace and behavior
modification trough semantic actions round up the whole system.

UniCC is technically a target language independent parser generator, which
means that it is not bound to a special programming language. Currently, only
support of the C programming language is given due the UniCC Standard C Parser
Template. More standard templates for other languages like C++ and Java will be
developed and released in future by Phorward Software Technologies, but are not
available for now; Any help and support on this area is appreciated.

UniCC has been developed since 2006 and has its origin at Phorward Software
Technologies and is initially written and maintained by its 1985 born core
developer, Jan Max Meyer. Phorward Software Technologies is a software-company
from Dortmund, Germany, which focuses its business on compiler construction,
scripting languages and software development tools, both in the area of open
source and proprietary solutions.

From the project view, the UniCC parser generator consists currently of two
different parts.

These are

- The UniCC LALR(1) Parser Generator, which is an open source project
  released under the Artistic License, version 2.
- The UniCC Standard C Parser Template (C.tlt), which is part of the UniCC
  package, and released under the BSD-license.

This document should serve as an initial developer's note on how to compile
UniCC and set up its environment. There is also additional documentation in
form of a User's Manual available, which can be obtained via the Phorward
Software Technologies website.

the latest news, documentation, updates and support on the UniCC LALR(1) Parser
Generator.

 REQUIREMENTS
**************
UniCC is a product that was entirely established and developed on top of the
Phorward Foundation Libraries (to be more exactly, many parts of the Phorward
Foundation Libraries have their origin in earlier development stages of the
UniCC Parser Generator, but where moved into libraries for usage outside
UniCC).

The Phorward Foundation Libraries are the development environment of Phorward
Software Technologies, and provides a build-environment, toolchain and library
toolkit that will be used by several projects created by Phorward Software
Technologies.

The Phorward Foundation Libraries are released under the BSD License.

****************
 BUILDING UNICC
****************
Before you can build UniCC, ensure that you have installed the Phorward
Foundation Libraries in its latest version.

Get the latest sources using Mercurial with

	hg clone http://phorward.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/phorward/phorward 

then follow the installation instructions in the README file.

When this is done, move to the $PHOME/src directory of your Phorward Foundation
Libraries installation by simply typing

	s
	
and clone the following repositories. They provide the UniCC LALR(1) Parser
Generator, the UniCC Standard C Parser Template and XPL, a demonstration of
a tiny programming language implementation written with UniCC.

	hg clone http://unicc.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/unicc/unicc
	hg clone http://unicc.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/unicc/Cparser
	hg clone http://unicc.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/unicc/xpl

Then, run

	echo "export UNICC_TPLDIR=$PHOME/src/Cparser" >>$PHOME/etc/userenv
	chmod +x $PHOME/etc/userenv
	. $PHOME/etc/userenv
	
on the console. This will create a permanent user-defined environment script
that is applied the next time you setup the Phorward Foundation Libraries
environment, and also updates the current environment to get the variable
UNICC_TPLDIR known.

After this, run

	echo "pbasis pregex pstring min_lalr1 Cparser unicc xpl" >makeall-seq

This will create an extended build-sequence for the makeall script, which is
part of the Phorward Foundation Libraries.

Finally compile all modules by simply typing

	make

After a successful build, UniCC can be invoked with

	unicc
	
and is available in $PHOME/run.

Have fun with UniCC!
