unicc - LALR(1) Parser Generator


SYNOPSIS
========

unicc [OPTION]... FILE


DESCRIPTION
===========

UniCC, standing as an acronym for universal compiler-compiler, is a powerful
LALR(1) parser generator and development system for computer professionals.
Its design-goal is to serve as an all-round design and build tool for any
parsing-related issue, including production-quality compiler construction and
the implementation of domains specific languages.

UniCC unions an integrated generator for lexical analyzers and a powerful
LALR(1) parser generator into one software solution.
The programming interface is a rich, extendable and innovative EBNF-based
grammar definition language, which gives any compiler-developer's task much
more comfort and simplicity in implementing parsers than ever before. It comes
with useful features for both grammar prototyping and design, parser
optimization, semantic augmentation and parser programming. Lexical symbols can
be directly defined within productions, right-hand side items can be referenced
by meaningful names within semantic actions, instead of only their offsets.
Features like virtual- and embedded-productions finally help to rapidly build-up
iterative and optional grammatical structures.

Standard features like automatic conflict resolution, terminal and production
precedence association, state compression as well as parser trace and behavior
modification trough semantic actions round up the whole system.

UniCC is technically a target language independent parser generator, which
means that it is not bound to a special programming language. Currently, only
support of the C programming language is given due the UniCC Standard C Parser
Template. More standard templates for other languages like C++ and Java will be
developed and released in future by Phorward Software Technologies, but are not
available for now; Any help and support on this area is appreciated.

UniCC has been developed since 2006 and has its origin at Phorward Software
Technologies and is initially written and maintained by its 1985 born core
developer, Jan Max Meyer. Phorward Software Technologies is a software company
from Dortmund, Germany, which focuses its business on compiler construction,
scripting languages and software development tools, both in the area of open
source and proprietary solutions.

This document should serve as a quick reference note on how to use UniCC and
set up its environment. There is also additional documentation in form of a
User's Manual available, which is included into the binary packages of UniCC
and can be obtained from the Phorward Software Technologies website.

the latest news, documentation, updates and support on the UniCC LALR(1) Parser
Generator.


FEATURES
========

The UniCC LALR(1) Parser Generator features the following, unique tools and
possibilities.

- A powerful and inovative BNF-based grammar definition language
- Full Unicode support
- Build-in lexical analyzer generator
- Grammar prototyping features
- Virtual productions
- Anonymous nonterminals
- Semantically determined symbols
- Two parser construction modes allow the use of different algorithmic
    approaches relating the whitespace handling
- Target-language independent parser development
- Template-based program-module generator and XML-based parser description
    file generator
- Platform-independent (console-based)
- Standard LALR(1) conflict resolution
- Supporting the C programming language via the UniCC Standard C Parser
    Template, providing many useful features like integrated Syntax Tree
    Generator and Error Recovery


ENVIRONMENT SETUP
=================

To get UniCC work properly, the unicc executable must be in the PATH.
It is also required to set an environment variable UNICC_TPLDIR that directs
to a directory holding the UniCC target language templates. If UNICC_TPLDIR is
not set, UniCC will automatically check for templates in $prefix/share/unicc/tlt
on Linux/Unix.


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
====================

The UniCC command-line interface supports various, combinable options to
invoke, modify and specialize the parser generation process, or to trigger
further tasks.

-a, --all-warnings

	Runs UniCC to print all warnings that come up with the grammar. UniCC
	normaly supresses some warning messages that raise up during the parse
	table constructions according to their importance.

-b NAME, --basename NAME

	Defines the specified basename NAME to be used for the output
	file(s) instead of the one derived by the #prefix-directive or by the
	name of the input filename. This basename is used for all output files
	if the provided parser template causes the construction of multiple
	files.

-G, --grammar

	Dumps an overview of the finally constructred grammar to stderr, right
	before the parse-tables are generated.

-h, --help

	Prints a short overview about the command-line options and exists.

-n, --no-opt

	Disables state optimization; By default, the resulting LALR(1) parse
	states are optimized during table construction by introducing a special
	SHIFT_REDUCE action which combines a shift and reduction, which is
	possible when the last symbol of a production is shifted. Standard
	LALR(1) parsers only support SHIFT or REDUCE, not both operations at the
	same time. When this option is used, UniCC produces about 20-30% more
	LALR(1) states.

-P, --production

	Dumps an overview about the finally produced productions and their
	semantic actions.

-s, --stats

	Prints a statistics message to stderr when parser generation has
	entirely been finished. This will automatically switched on when
	using the verbose option.

-S, --states

	Dumps the generated LALR(1) states that had been generated during the
	parse table generation process.

-t, --stdout

	Print all code generator output to stdout instead as files.

-T, --symbols

	Dumps an overview of all used symbols.

-v, --verbose

	Prints process messages about the specific tasks during parser generation
	process. Automatically switches on the stats option for statistics output.

-V, --version

	Prints copyright and version information and exits.

-w, --warnings

	Print relevant warnings.

-x, --xml

	Triggers UniCC to run the parser description file generator additionally
	to the program module generator. The parser description file generator
	outputs an XML-based parser representation of the generated parse tables,
	which can be used by third-party code generators or grammar analsys and
	debugging tools.

-X, --XML

	Triggers UniCC to only run the parser description file generator
	without running the program-module generator.

Errors and warnings are printed to STDERR, any other kind of output to STDOUT.


BUILDING UNICC FROM SOURCE
==========================

UniCC is a software that was entirely established and developed on top of the
Phorward Toolkit. 

The Phorward Toolkit and its library libphorward provide many useful
functions for general purpose and extended software-development tasks,
including standard data structures, a system-independent interface, extending
data types and regular expression management functions, required by UniCC to
construct the lexical analyzers.

The Phorward Toolkit is released under the BSD License, more information can 
be obtained from the official product website at http://phorward-software.com.

Before UniCC can be built, ensure that the Phorward Toolkit is installed in
its latest version.

Getting the latest version is simple using the Mercurial SCM with

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/codepilot/phorward

then, change into the cloned directory and run

    ./configure
    make
    make install

After that, clone the following repositories. They provide the UniCC Parser
Generator and XPL, a demonstration of a tiny programming language implementation
written with UniCC.

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/codepilot/unicc
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/codepilot/xpl

Optionally, if hacking the UniCC Standard C Parser Template is wanted, clone

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/codepilot/cparser

also.

Change into the directory unicc and, again run

    ./configure
    make
    make install

After UniCC was successfully built and installed, xpl can be compiled
out of the box without any configuration script.

If the UniCC bootstrapping toolchain is wanted, configure UniCC with

    ./configure --with-bootstrap

this will bootstrap the UniCC grammar parser with multiple generation states.

When bootstraping toolchain is enabled, it is additionally required to install
the min_lalr1 parser generator. This program can be obtained with

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/codepilot/min_lalr1
