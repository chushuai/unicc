UniCC4C was the idea of providing an extended tool-chain for UniCC targetting the C programming language, and working on the XML-based UniCC parser description files. It contains stubs for generators that are able to generate more performant parts of the parser than the table-driven one provided by Cparser.

The project has been under development in and until 2010 but was not continued or finished. So this directory contains some pieces of code that represent a vision or maybe some stub of code that never reached any goal.

The code is now put into the Cparser repository (many parts of UniCC4C based on parts of the Cparser) and therefore released under the 3-clause BSD license, same as Cparser. This directory is not working and the Makefile should be revised. Its only the code that may be interesting (or not!).

Have fun!
